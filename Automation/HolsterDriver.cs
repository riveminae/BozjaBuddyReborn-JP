/// <summary>
/// Uses configured Lost Actions out of the holster during an engagement.
///
/// ONE CALL, TWO BEHAVIOURS. PublicContentBozja.UseFromHolster(holsterIndex, slot) is documented
/// as "use lost action from holster INTO specified duty action slot (slot is ignored for items,
/// which are used directly)" - the contrast is the whole point, and reading it the other way is
/// what left this class half a feature until 1.0.21.0. For an ITEM-type holster entry (every
/// Essence, the kits, Dynamis Dice, Lodestone, Light Curtain, Resistance Elixir - see
/// LostActionCatalog) that call IS the use and there is nothing further to do. For an ACTION-type
/// entry it only LOADS the duty slot; the charge is spent by pressing that slot, which is
/// DutyActions.Press. This class used to make the first call for both kinds and report true, so
/// it reloaded a slot on a timer and never fired a single action-type Lost Action.
///
/// THE LOAD IS NOT INSTANT, so the press is a second step and not a second line. UseFromHolster
/// returns before the game has populated the duty slot - pressing in the same tick reads whatever
/// was in the slot beforehand, which is the one outcome worse than not firing: a different, and
/// possibly much more expensive, Lost Action spent by accident. So a load moves the driver into
/// WaitingForLoad and the press happens on a later tick, only once the slot itself reports the
/// action id we asked for, with that same id handed to DutyActions.Press so its own mismatch guard
/// is a second lock on the same door. If the slot never comes up - the game refused, the fight
/// moved on - the attempt is abandoned on a timeout and reported rather than pressed hopefully.
///
/// SPENDING IS A SEPARATE OPT-IN. AutoUseLostActions has never once spent an action-type charge,
/// so quietly completing it would have changed what a switch the user already ticked costs them.
/// Configuration.AutoFireLostActions is that decision, taken explicitly and default off; with it
/// off, action-type entries are skipped entirely rather than loaded, because loading a slot
/// nothing will press is pure churn that also stamps on whatever loadout was sitting in it.
///
/// AND IT WILL NOT RE-APPLY WHAT YOU ALREADY HAVE. Everything here runs on a timer, which is the
/// one arrangement guaranteed to re-buff something still running: an Essence ticked in the list
/// used to be consumed every cooldown window for the whole half-hour it was already up, and Lost
/// Protect re-pressed every eight seconds. So an entry whose status LostActionStatuses can name is
/// skipped while that status is on the player, and the window goes to the next thing in the
/// priority order instead. An entry with no known status is never refused - see
/// LostActionStatuses for why that is the right direction to fail.
///
/// Deliberately conservative throughout: opt-in, one action per cooldown window, and only while
/// actually in combat inside an engagement. Lost Actions are a finite, farmed resource - burning
/// them on trash because a timer elapsed is worse than not using them at all.
