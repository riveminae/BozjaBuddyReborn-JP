/// HOW JOINING ACTUALLY WORKS, because the whole class turns on it and the previous version had
/// it half right. From the Patch 5.35 notes: critical engagements "do not require you to be
/// present in the field to participate. Instead, players must request deployment via the
/// Resistance Recruitment window." So this is a menu, not a place - walking into the marked
/// circle does not enrol you.
///
/// AND IT IS TWO CLICKS, IN TWO PHASES, WHICH IS THE PART THAT WAS MISSING:
///
///   1. REGISTER, during the ~60s registration phase. This enters a lottery against the
///      engagement's participant cap (24, or 48 for the large-scale ones).
///   2. COMMENCE, during the ~120s preparation phase, and ONLY if the lottery picked you. This
///      is the click that actually puts you in the arena. "Permission to join critical
///      engagement granted! N minute remains to deploy" is the message that opens this phase.
///
/// The button is one button whose label changes: Register -> Withdraw once you are in the
/// lottery -> Commence once you have been selected. A single press can therefore never complete
/// a join, and the old implementation fired once and then watched the ENGAGEMENT's state - which
/// advances on the game's own timer whether or not you did anything, so it reported success for
/// doing nothing.
///
/// WHY THE BUTTON IS CLICKED RATHER THAN A CALLBACK FIRED. The old code fired
/// Callback.Fire(addon, true, index) - a bare int, at a row index, with a comment admitting the
/// shape was inferred rather than observed. Nothing anywhere drives this addon: no plugin in the
/// local corpus of several hundred references it, and FFXIVClientStructs exposes no join method
/// on the agent. Every windowed list addon in ECommons that DOES have per-row buttons uses a
/// leading command selector rather than a bare index, so the guess was very likely wrong - and a
/// wrong payload is not inert, it is an unknown command.
///
/// Clicking the button node needs no payload at all: ClickAddonButton reads the AtkEvent the
/// game already attached to that button and hands it back through ReceiveEvent, which is how
/// ECommons drives every other confirm button in the game. The label is then also the honest
/// answer to "am I registered", with no struct to guess at.
///
/// LOCALISATION IS THE ONE REMAINING ASSUMPTION: the labels matched below are the English
/// client's. Every button found is logged with its text, so a non-English client produces a log
/// line naming exactly what to add rather than a silent failure.
