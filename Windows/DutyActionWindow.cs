/// A duty-action hotbar for the whole group.
///
/// One row per box, two slots each - the same two Duty Action slots the game gives you - showing
/// the icon, the charges and the recharge exactly as your own hotbar shows them, AND pressable.
/// The point is that a multibox operator can see at a glance which box still has an Essence or a
/// Lost Action up without cycling windows, and can then fire it without focusing that box's game
/// window - which is the same job the Phantom Job bar does in Occult Crescent.
///
/// Your own row is read live from DutyActionManager every frame; peer rows arrive over the
/// multibox pipe twice a second and have their cooldowns aged forward locally in between, so
/// every sweep moves smoothly rather than stepping.
///
/// NOTHING IS PRESSED FROM HERE. An ImGui click happens inside the draw callback, which is not the
/// framework thread and may not touch game memory - so a click only ever ENQUEUES a BoxCommand,
/// exactly the one a remote instruction would be, and the controller's per-frame pump carries it
/// out on a legal thread. Your own slot and a peer's slot therefore take one code path and cannot
/// drift in behaviour. See <see cref="DutyActions.Press"/> for what happens at the far end, and
/// <see cref="BoxVerb.DutyAction"/> for why the instruction names the action and not just the slot.
